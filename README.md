## 5. Dataset

This project uses the **Polyvore Dataset**, which was introduced in the ACM Multimedia 2017 paper:

**“Learning Fashion Compatibility with Bidirectional LSTMs”**  
(ACM MM 2017)

The dataset is widely used in academic research for evaluating **fashion compatibility, outfit recommendation, and visual similarity learning**.

### 5.1 Dataset Description

The Polyvore Dataset consists of:
- Fashion product images
- Outfit combinations created by users
- Category labels and metadata
- Compatibility relationships between fashion items

The dataset is suitable for:
- Image-based fashion embedding
- Compatibility learning
- Similar item recommendation
- Fashion outfit analysis

### 5.2 Dataset Sources

- **Original Images (Kaggle):**  
  The raw images are publicly available on Kaggle and can be downloaded separately.

- **Cleaned Version:**  
  A cleaned and pre-processed version of the Polyvore dataset is provided by the University of Maryland:
  - *Cleaned Maryland Polyvore Dataset*

### 5.4 Usage in This Project

In this project, the Polyvore Dataset is used for:
- Training the fashion image embedding model
- Learning visual similarity between fashion items
- Supporting recommendation based on image features

Due to storage limitations, the dataset and trained models are **not included directly in this repository** and are provided via Google Drive.

### 5.5 Related Datasets

In addition to the Polyvore Dataset, the following dataset may be of interest for further research:

- **A100 Dataset**  
  A dataset designed to evaluate the **aesthetic ability of AI models**, focusing on visual quality and style perception.

This dataset is not used in the current implementation but can be explored for future improvements.
